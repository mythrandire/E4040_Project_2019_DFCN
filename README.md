# Deformable Convolution and MNIST

This repo contains the code for a project I worked on to investigate how deformable convolution could help make MNIST classifiers be more robust to geometric perturbations in the input digits. 

The project was for the Fall 2019 course *ECBM E4040: Neural Networks \& Deep Learning* at Columbia University, taught by Prof. Zoran Kostic.
